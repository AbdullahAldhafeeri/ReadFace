ðŸš€ Face Recognition Using DeepFace + OpenCV (Real-Time!)
I'm excited to share a recent project I worked on: a real-time face recognition system using Python, DeepFace, and OpenCV.

ðŸ“Œ What does it do?
The system captures live video from the webcam and compares detected faces with a folder of known images. If a match is found, it displays the person's name â€” otherwise, it shows "Unknown."

ðŸ§  Powered by:

DeepFace â€“ for face verification using AI
OpenCV â€“ to access the webcam and process video frames
Python â€“ bringing it all together
ðŸ’¡ Features:

Real-time face recognition
Easy to add new faces (just add a photo!)
100% offline â€“ no internet required
Lightweight and Windows-friendly
ðŸŽ¯ This project is a great foundation for:

Attendance systems
Security access control
Emotion or age/gender analysis (coming soon ðŸ˜‰)
If you're working on anything similar or have ideas to improve it â€” letâ€™s connect!
